# Terraforge
Terraforge is a platform designed for users to easily recycle, bid, and get paid out on Electronic waste. E-waste is a massive issue, with over 50 million tons of electronic waste generated annually. Terraforge creates a one-stop shop for users to recycle or sell their waste, and receive payouts for doing so.


As a user, you will be able to submit an item they would like to recycle or list for sale. Once the item is submitted, it will be listed on our database.

If you opt to list it for sale, any user will be able to bid on your item in cash and receive your token value, while you'll receive their cash bid. This ensures the end user will still receive cash value or token value based bids received, and users without electronics can still invest and receive tokens through our auction style system.

Per financial quarter, Terraforge will allocate a set percentage of revenue generated from recycling users e-waste to burn the circulating supply of tokens, limiting volume and increasing value of each individual token.
